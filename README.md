Sentiment Signal Engine – Generating Buy/Sell Signals from Structured Market Data

Project Link: https://ee590-projectwebsite-arjundeshmukh.streamlit.app/

This project is a multi-factor trading-signal engine built in Python and Streamlit.

It combines:

Structured market data – OHLCV prices and technical indicators (MA20, MA50, RSI14, volume).

Unstructured text data – recent news headlines scored with NLP-based sentiment.

User-defined weights – to generate a 0–100 composite score and a discrete BUY / HOLD / SELL signal for each stock.

The app lets you:

Scan a universe of large-cap U.S. stocks grouped by sector.

Rank tickers by composite score and signal.

Inspect historical signals overlaid on price charts.

Read recent headlines that drive the sentiment component.
